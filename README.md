# Kanban
Excel-based Kanban board, issue tracking, and analytics

Rather than spread across several workbooks, the goal is to have as much as possible for a project available within one workbook.

## Downloading the Workbook
You can download this and earlier versions on the [releases](https://github.com/USDepartmentofLabor/Kanban/releases) page or you can clone this repo to your machine.

## Using The Workbook
### The tabs
The green, red, and blue tabs are the ones where you can do data entry.  
The purple tabs are intended to be read-only.
The orange tabs are charts.
### Getting Started
Get started by adding your WIP limits and project code in the settings sheet (hidden by default)
